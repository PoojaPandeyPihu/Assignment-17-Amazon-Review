  ¬†Most smartwatches and smartband offer more or less of similar functionalities except for the ones where we can take calls on the watch itself. I wanted to get an Apple Watch for my wife as I was impressed by the design but fortunately I found this Noise ColorFit Pro 2 which looks very similar and premium like the Apple watch. Bought this one for Rs.2999.----------------------üì¶ IN THE BOX----------------------·ç® The smart watch module with screen protector applied·ç® 22mm wide TPU strap·ç® Charging cable·ç® Instruction Manual and Warranty Registration card--------------------‚åö FEATURES--------------------·ç® 1.3 inch 240x240 capacitive display·ç® Curved glass with anti-fingerprint coating,·ç® IP68 Full dustproof and waterproof·ç® 210 mah battery - 7 to 10 days usage, 45 days standby·ç® Bluetooth 5.0 BLE·ç® 24/7 heart Rate sensor, sedentary alarm, breathe feature, and usual health and sleep monitoring.·ç® App, message, social media and call notifications.·ç® Music control·ç® Menstrual cycle tracking·ç® 9 sports mode - Walk, Yoga, Spin, Run, Climb, Workout, Bike, Hike, Treadmill.---------------------üóìÔ∏è MY USAGE---------------------·ç® At just 35g weight and 22mm TPU band makes this band the very comfortable to wear. Also the strap is skin friendly and I didn‚Äôt get allergy with sweat on this band.·ç® The straps is easy to swap and replace if required and uses the spring pin type.·ç® The charging is a magnetic ping type and there is no need to remove straps or do anything. I felt this type of charging the easiest of all.·ç® The looks is very premium, though is made up of polycarbonate, the grey and black colors, the curved display on the sides and the size make it look like an Apple Watch.·ç® There are only 5 of watch faces and some of them are like the Apple watch face design. As of now the watch faces are limited and customization is limited, I hope customizations will be made available.·ç® The display is beautiful and under direct sunlight I found the watch display visible, though not the best visibility but to a certain extent.·ç® There is 1 button the side which looks like the watch crown and it acts as the function button and return button. I found it easy to navigate using the touch display and using this button.·ç® The IP68 certification means now I I don't have to worry about protection from water even more than 1m depth (IP_8) and also no need to worry about dirt (IP6_).·ç® Health, fitness and sleep tracking is very accurate in my opinion, and surprisingly the NoiseFit sport app is also good. The breathe is just to take a break and just asks us to take a deep breathe. I found using a continuous heart rate sensor get the battery under 7 days and when this feature is turned off, it takes to almost 10 days.·ç® The sleep, heart rate and health tracking are pretty accurate in my opinion. Most of the features available in smart bands and basic smart watches were available.·ç® I can now read messages and notification from the band easily. From the app I was able to turn off and on what notifications need to be shown on the watch and notifications can be enabled for vibrations.·ç® There are some quick access shortcuts from the watch like find my phone, turn off/on continuous heart rate monitoring, Do not Disturb, wrist. The female health care feature of menstrual cycle and ovulations cycle is a nice add in my opinion.-------------------------üíñ WHAT I LIKED-------------------------‚óæ The premium design and great display. Much better than other smartwatches and bands in this category in my opinion.‚óæ Battery life of 7 to 10 days.‚óæ IPX68 dust and waterproof.‚óæ Pretty accurate fitness, health and sleep monitoring‚óæ Better control & display of calls, messages and music from the band-------------------------------------------------‚ôªÔ∏è WHAT I FELT CAN BE IMPROVED-------------------------------------------------‚óæ More exercise or activities could have been included like Badminton etc.‚óæ Only 5 watch faces available but heard there will be more added this year.-------------------üç± OVERALL-------------------The MiBand 4 is definitely feature rich and Noise ColorFit Pro 2 has similar or a bit more features, I found this one much better in areas like build, design, charging. I don't have a Honor Band so I can't compare but at this price category in my perspective this band is the best. ü•á

1,Gaurav,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Pathetic quality product, not even worth 1000 rupees.  Its highly overpriced & is not as advertised.  The heart rate does not work, its very slow & the touch does not even respond most of the time.Do not buy this product, its a waste of money!

3,Mahir Dalwale,Looks doesn't matter.. Completely Worthless!!,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Apart from showing accurate time & much healthy battery & looks like Apple Watch, this Smart (Fitness) watch do nothing as the company represents it.Don't know, how can people have wrote positive about this.It was the only reviews basis what I've bought this & find useless after the item received.I guess, it was their first Fitness watch & that's why they liked this.Trust me, please go for Honor, Huawei, Samsung bands.They actually shows you the fact-based info about your fitness. I've Honor Band 5 & I just loved it still.Afterall, brand is brand & that's the only reason their products are on higher side in terms of price.

6,Sneha K,Don't buy this product!!,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  Don't buy this product!!I received this product on 23rd December and used it for 4 days down, the product automatically gets disconnected and they you will have to uninstall the Noise app which is essential to use this watch then reinstall, after reinstalling it doesn't allow you to connect to the smart watch this happens continuously, i tried turning off the watch and doing the entire process again but all in vain.... Absolute dissatisfaction ü•∫ü•∫üò¨üò¨

Don't purchase or u will regret..I had ordered for replacement also and same problem found in other product also..this means it's s manufacturing problem..2nd issue very delay in process3rd issue it's having touch than also u have to lift ur arms to see the watch..one tap option not given.4th issue vibrator is not so strong like Mi Band.request to go for other watch not Noise clorfit pro 2..

8,A P.,Read it! before buying,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  The product is good for  the price it is being sold. Accuracy is 3.5/5, look wise 5/5, battery life 4/5, screen response 3/5  but the main problem is with the application. Whenever the watch is out of Bluetooth range and comes back again in range of mobile it does not get automatically paired with mobile. every time you have to reinstall the application from the play store and again pair it. because of this all the data is lost and count start from ""zero"".i will not recommend this watch because of the application problem and makers of app also don't bother about fixing the issue.Go for mi smartband or any other band but just don't go for this

9,Ronnie,Value for money,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  After using for 20 days, i am here to write a review. This product is well packed and user manual is good. You cant connect with your smartphone directly with bluetooth. You need to download noisefit app for that and need to connect your watch. Connectivity is good. Fraction of seconds delay on notification. Display is good, feel is good. Looks is very good. SNS, like whats app, msg, facebook and other app notification you can see only. You can see the first line of each notification, but cant enter into the msg. To read the msg you need to use your phone(unless the msg is one liner).Heart rate monitor is closely correct. Step count is good. Sports mode is great. Real count of a cumulative of 3 steps. Alarm works well. Truly water proof(follow the IP68 standard). Dont use in salt water, it can damage.My usage is very high and still i get 4 days battery back up. Its pretty good.According to the cost of the product, you cant expect more than that. Its recommended to use this product.
